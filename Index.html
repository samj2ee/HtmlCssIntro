                The history of video games began in the 1950s and 1960s as<br> computer scientists
                began designing simple games and simulations on minicomputers and mainframes.<br> 
                Spacewar! was developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) student hobbyists<br>
                 in 1962 as one of the first such games on a video display.<br>
                  The first consumer video game hardware was released in the early 1970s.<br> 
                  The first home video game console was the Magnavox Odyssey,<br>
                   and the first arcade video games were Computer Space and Pong.<br> 
                   After its home console conversions, numerous companies sprang up to capture <br>
                   Pong's success in both the arcade and the home by cloning the game, <br>
                   causing a series of boom and bust cycles due to oversaturation and lack of innovation. </p>
